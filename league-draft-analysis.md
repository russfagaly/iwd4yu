## League Evolution

| Year | Teams | Format | Champion | Your Finish |
|------|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 2020 | 16 (4 divisions) | Shortened COVID season | The Disabled List | 12th |
| 2021 | 16 | Full season | DC Race Relations | Unknown |
| 2022 | 16 | Full season | Never Break The Chaim | 11th |
| 2023 | 16 | Full season | Cuck Showalters | Playoffs (lost semis) |
| 2024 | 16 | Full season | **I Would Die 4 YU** | **1st (Champion)** |
| 2025 | 14 | Full season | WaRshington Natinals | 4th (lost semis) |
| 2026 | 12 | — | TBD | — |

**Teams that left:** DC Race Relations & The Disabled List (after 2024), Human Highlight Reel & Panda Xpress (after 2025).

**Owner name changes:**
- You: Good Burrito Please (2020–21) → I Would Die 4 YU (2022+)
- Chaim owner: Bauer Units (2020) → Trevor Bauer is a Scumbag (2021) → Never Break The Chaim (2022+)

**Key takeaway:** The league is shrinking (16 → 14 → 12). With fewer teams, the talent pool is deeper — mid-round players in 2025 are early-round quality in a 12-team format. Adjust ADP expectations accordingly.

## League-Wide Draft Trends

### Hitter vs. Pitcher Split by Round (5-year aggregate)

| Round Range | Hitters | SP | RP | Notes |
|-------------|---------|----|----|-------|
| **1–3** | 58% | 34% | 8% | Pitching is heavily valued early — 1 in 3 picks is a pitcher |
| **4–5** | 64% | 20% | 16% | RP peaks here — closers go in Rounds 4–5 |
| **6–7** | 71% | 19% | 10% | Transition zone — pitching still available |
| **8–11** | 77% | 13% | 9% | Hitter-dominated, but SP2/SP3 types still drafted |
| **12–17** | 84% | 9% | 5% | Deep hitter territory — pitching largely done |
| **18–23** | 87% | 10% | 2% | Lottery tickets and bench bats |

### Key Findings

**This league drafts pitching EARLY.** In Round 1, 30% of picks are pitchers (compared to ~15% in typical leagues). This is driven by:
- 5 SP slots and 4 RP slots demanding a large pitching roster
- 7x7 format with HLD and BSV making relievers more valuable
- Negative BB and K categories rewarding elite arms

**Relievers peak in Rounds 2–5.** The league's unique HLD/BSV categories make elite closers and setup men Round 2–5 picks. After Round 5, RP value drops sharply — most teams have their RP1 by then.

**Catchers go late or not at all in the draft.** The C position is rarely drafted before Round 10, despite being a required slot. Teams fill it with late-round picks or waiver wire adds.

## Round-by-Round Breakdown

### Rounds 1–3: Foundation Rounds
- **70% hitters, 27% SP, 3% RP** in Round 1
- **52% hitters, 34% SP, 13% RP** in Rounds 2–3
- This is where ace SPs and elite closers go
- Common Round 1 pitcher picks: Scherzer, Kershaw, Glasnow, Corbin Burnes, Chris Sale, Zack Wheeler
- If you want an ace SP, you need to take one by Round 3

### Rounds 4–7: Roster Construction
- Mix of SP2/SP3 arms, top closers, and solid everyday hitters
- **RP drafting peaks in Rounds 4–5** (16% of all picks)
- Key strategy zone: if you went hitter-heavy in Rounds 1–3, pitching must start here

### Rounds 8–12: Value Hunting
- Mostly hitters (75–88%)
- Mid-rotation SPs and setup men still available
- This is where draft winners are made — breakout candidates and undervalued vets

### Rounds 13–18: Bench and Depth
- 85%+ hitters
- Occasional SP flier or speculative RP add
- Positional fill (C, backup IF/OF)

### Rounds 19–23: Keeper Stashes and Lottery Tickets
- Almost entirely hitters (87–94%)
- **This is where keeper leagues are won** — Bobby Witt Jr. went in Rd 10 (2023), Rd 7 (2024), Rd 9 (2025). Julio Rodríguez has been a late-round keeper stash for years
- Top prospects and injured stars are common targets

## Team-by-Team Scouting Reports

### #BlackCommissioners
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 78% H / 13% SP / 8% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 4.0 |
| Avg first RP | Round 3.7 |
| Best finish | Unknown (never champion) |

**Profile: RP-first pitching approach.** This owner drafts RPs before SPs, grabbing closers by Round 3–4. In 2020, they kept 8 players (the most keepers in the dataset). Their Round 1 picks show a preference for elite position players (Rendon, Semien, Arenado, Ohtani) with one exception (Luis Castillo in 2024). Tends to load up on hitters in the middle rounds.

**Exploit:** They rarely draft SPs early, so ace starters will still be available if you pick after them.

---

### Cuck Showalters (2023 Champion)
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 75% H / 17% SP / 6% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 1.8 |
| Avg first RP | Round 4.6 |
| Best finish | **1st (2023)** |

**Profile: Balanced with early SP lean.** Takes a pitcher in Round 1 or 2 almost every year. Championship year (2023) started with Ozzie Albies (Rd 1), Zack Wheeler (Rd 2), Carlos Rodón (Rd 3) — a strong SP foundation paired with a high-floor hitter. Doesn't chase RPs early (avg Rd 4.6 for first RP).

**Exploit:** Predictably takes an SP in the first 2 rounds. If you need a specific hitter, they likely won't be competing for them.

---

### Curtis Granderslams
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 78% H / 11% SP / 9% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 6.8 |
| Avg first RP | Round 3.8 |
| Best finish | Middle of the pack |

**Profile: Hitter-obsessed.** Waits the longest of anyone to draft a pitcher (avg Round 6.8 for first SP). Famously loyal — drafted Freddie Freeman in Round 1 three years in a row (2020, 2022, 2023). Grabs RPs earlier than SPs, suggesting they value bullpen arms over rotation depth. Has used keepers (2020: 2 keepers, 2024: 1 keeper).

**Exploit:** Starting pitchers will always be available after their picks. They create a run on hitters in the early rounds.

---

### D.C. Funbaggers
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 74% H / 20% SP / 4% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 3.0 |
| Avg first RP | Round 11.8 |
| Best finish | 3rd (2025) |

**Profile: SP-heavy, ignores RPs until late.** The most SP-heavy drafter in the league (20% of all picks are starting pitchers). Opens with a hitter then takes SPs in Rounds 2–4. Almost completely ignores RPs until Round 12+ (avg first RP: Round 11.8 — latest in the league). Clayton Kershaw was their Round 1 pick in 2020.

**Exploit:** They'll never compete with you for closers or setup men. But they will snap up mid-tier SPs quickly.

---

### Late Round Fliers
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 79% H / 12% SP / 8% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 2.8 |
| Avg first RP | Round 6.8 |
| Best finish | 3rd (2024) |

**Profile: Hitter-first, pitcher-patient.** Loads up on hitters early (19 hitters in Rounds 1–5 across 5 drafts, the most of any team). Takes a pitcher by Round 3 but it's usually just one. Mixes in an RP around Rounds 5–7. Named after their strategy — they believe in finding value late.

**Exploit:** They create demand for early-round hitters. If you're comfortable going pitcher-heavy early, you can dodge their picks entirely.

---

### LowBallers
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 73% H / 22% SP / 4% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 4.8 |
| Avg first RP | Round 11.0 |
| Best finish | 2nd (2024) |

**Profile: SP accumulator, RP-averse.** Second-highest SP% in the league (22%) but rarely touches RPs (4% — tied for lowest). Waits until Round 11 on average for their first reliever. Their 2022 draft (Brandon Woodruff Rd 1, Aaron Nola Rd 2) was the most pitcher-aggressive opening in the dataset.

**Exploit:** Like D.C. Funbaggers, they won't compete for RPs. But they WILL snap up SP value.

---

### Machine Needs Sugar
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 80% H / 11% SP / 8% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 1.4 |
| Avg first RP | Round 5.0 |
| Best finish | 2nd (2020, 2025) |

**Profile: Drafts a pitcher immediately, then goes hitter.** Has the earliest average first pitcher (Round 1.4) — took an SP in Round 1 in 3 of 5 years (José Berríos 2020 Rd 2, Aaron Nola 2023, Logan Webb 2024, Corbin Burnes 2025). After grabbing their ace, they pivot hard to hitters. Consistent playoff contender (2nd place twice, 3rd once) but has never won the championship.

**Exploit:** Their ace SP pick in Round 1–2 is predictable. If they pick before you, expect a pitcher to come off the board.

---

### Never Break The Chaim (2022 Champion)
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 81% H / 12% SP / 6% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 2.2 |
| Avg first RP | Round 7.8 |
| Best finish | **1st (2022)** |

**Profile: Shohei Ohtani loyalist, hitter-heavy.** Drafted Ohtani (Batter) in Round 1 three years straight (2022–2024). Most hitter-heavy team in the league (81%). Takes a pitcher by Round 2 but fills the rest of the roster with bats. Championship year (2022) started Ohtani Rd 1, Yu Darvish Rd 4, Mitch Haniger Rd 5 — heavy hitter lean with limited early pitching.

**Exploit:** If Ohtani isn't available (keeper?), their Round 1 pick is harder to predict. Otherwise, expect them to go bat-heavy.

---

### The Phavorites
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 82% H / 8% SP / 8% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 2.0 |
| Avg first RP | Round 2.0 |
| Best finish | Middle of the pack (never top 3) |

**Profile: Creature of habit, catcher lover.** Drafted J.T. Realmuto in Round 1 four straight years (2020–2024). Takes an RP in Round 2 almost every year (Aroldis Chapman, Raisel Iglesias 3x). Lowest SP% in the league (8%) — barely drafts starting pitchers at all, relying on RPs and the waiver wire for pitching.

**Exploit:** Their Round 1 (catcher) and Round 2 (closer) picks are the most predictable in the league. Plan around them. They'll never compete for starting pitchers.

---

### WaRshington Natinals (2025 Champion)
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 73% H / 18% SP / 7% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 2.2 |
| Avg first RP | Round 9.4 |
| Best finish | **1st (2025)**, 2nd (2023), 3rd (2021) |

**Profile: SP-focused, consistently competitive.** The most successful team in the dataset (champion, runner-up, and 3rd place finishes). Takes an SP in Rounds 1–2 consistently (Glasnow, Yamamoto, Chris Sale). Ignores RPs until Round 9+ (only D.C. Funbaggers and LowBallers wait longer). Heavy SP investment pays off — 18% of all picks are starters.

**Exploit:** They will always take a top SP early. If you want the same pitcher, you need to pick before them. Their RP ignorance means closers will be available in mid-rounds if they pick before you.

---

### Ya Gotta Believe
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 77% H / 16% SP / 6% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 1.4 |
| Avg first RP | Round 6.6 |
| Best finish | 2nd (2022) |

**Profile: Ace-first drafter.** Takes an SP in Round 1 more often than anyone (Strasburg, Ohtani Pitcher, Zack Wheeler twice). Strong SP lean early, then fills with hitters. Championship runner-up (2022) opened with Tim Anderson Rd 1 and Clayton Kershaw Rd 2. Loves high-end arms but doesn't chase RPs.

**Exploit:** Expect a Round 1 pitcher from this team. If you need the same ace, draft before them.

## Your Draft History (I Would Die 4 YU)

### Draft Profile
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Drafts analyzed | 5 (2020–2025) |
| Split | 73% H / 17% SP / 8% RP |
| Avg first pitcher | Round 1.8 |
| Avg first RP | Round 2.5 |
| Best finish | **1st (2024)** |

**You are the most RP-aggressive drafter in the league.** Your average first RP pick is Round 2.5 — no one else is close. You've opened with a reliever in Round 1 (Jordan Romano 2023, Emmanuel Clase 2025) and frequently have 2+ RPs by Round 5.

### Year-by-Year Breakdown

#### 2020 (Good Burrito Please) — 12th Place
- **Rd 1:** José Ramírez (strong)
- **Rd 2:** Adalberto Mondesi (high risk, high reward)
- **Rd 4:** Kirby Yates (RP in Rd 4)
- **Rd 6:** Edwin Díaz (2nd RP by Rd 6)
- **Problem:** Too many RPs too early (3 relievers by Rd 11), weak SP core, late-round hitters were mostly misses
- **Lesson:** RP-heavy without SP support doesn't work

#### 2022 — 11th Place
- **Rd 1:** Max Scherzer (ace SP — good)
- **Rd 3:** Shohei Ohtani Pitcher (another ace)
- **Rd 4:** Charlie Morton (3 SPs in top 4)
- **Problem:** SP-heavy but the mid-round hitters (Jared Walsh, Gavin Lux, Akil Baddoo) all busted
- **Lesson:** Great pitching can't overcome bad hitting picks. Hitter quality in Rounds 5–12 matters enormously.

#### 2023 — Playoffs (lost semis to eventual champion)
- **Rd 1:** Jordan Romano (RP in Rd 1 — bold)
- **Rd 5:** Pete Fairbanks (2nd RP by Rd 5)
- **Rd 7:** Paul Sewald (3rd RP by Rd 7)
- **Rd 10:** Bobby Witt Jr. (STEAL — kept in later years)
- **Rd 17–23:** Julio Rodríguez, Elly De La Cruz, Wander Franco, Juan Soto, Jordan Walker (keeper stash bonanza)
- **Lesson:** Late-round keeper picks (Witt, J-Rod, Elly, Soto) were brilliant and built a dynasty foundation. But RP-heavy opening rounds left the rotation thin.

#### 2024 — CHAMPION
- **Rd 1:** Corey Seager (elite SS — rare position)
- **Rd 2:** Grayson Rodriguez (SP2)
- **Rd 4–6:** Pete Fairbanks, Yennier Cano, Matt Brash (RP block)
- **Rd 7:** Bobby Witt Jr. (keeper from 2023)
- **Rd 14–21:** Julio Rodríguez, Elly De La Cruz, Fernando Tatis Jr., Juan Soto (keeper value)
- **Why it worked:** Elite SS + solid SP + RP block + MASSIVE keeper value from late rounds. The keeper stashes from 2023 matured into a championship roster. You essentially had 4 first-round talents at Round 14+ cost.

#### 2025 — 4th Place (lost semis)
- **Rd 1:** Emmanuel Clase (RP in Rd 1 again)
- **Rd 2–3:** Michael King, Mason Miller (SP + RP)
- **Rd 5–8:** Bryan Woo, Grayson Rodriguez, Jared Jones, Ryan Pepiot (SP block)
- **Rd 9:** Bobby Witt Jr. (keeper)
- **Rd 14–20:** Julio Rodríguez, Elly De La Cruz, Fernando Tatis Jr., Juan Soto (keeper value)
- **Why it fell short:** Strong roster but lost to WaRshington Natinals 4–9 in the semis. The RP-first approach (Clase Rd 1) may have cost an elite hitter or ace SP.

### Your Patterns
| Pattern | Frequency | Impact |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| RP in Round 1 | 2 of 5 years | Mixed — correlated with playoff appearances but not the championship |
| Keeper stashing (Rd 17+) | Every year since 2023 | **Massive edge** — your keeper pipeline is the best in the league |
| SP block (3+ SPs in first 8 rounds) | 3 of 5 years | Necessary for competing |
| Bobby Witt Jr. keeper | 3 straight years | Core piece, increasing round cost |

## Championship DNA

What do champions in this league have in common?

| Year | Champion | Rd 1 Pick | SP in Top 5 | RP in Top 5 | Key Trait |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 2020 | The Disabled List | Christian Yelich (H) | 1 (Trevor Bauer Rd 3) | 0 | Balanced, no RPs early |
| 2022 | Never Break The Chaim | Ohtani Batter | 1 (Yu Darvish Rd 4) | 0 | Hitter-heavy, minimal early pitching |
| 2023 | Cuck Showalters | Ozzie Albies (H) | 2 (Wheeler Rd 2, Rodón Rd 3) | 0 | Strong SP foundation, zero early RPs |
| 2024 | **I Would Die 4 YU** | Corey Seager (H) | 1 (G. Rodriguez Rd 2) | 2 (Fairbanks Rd 4, Cano Rd 5) | Keeper value dominance |
| 2025 | WaRshington Natinals | Chris Sale (SP) | 3 (Sale Rd 1, Yamamoto Rd 2, Webb Rd 3) | 0 | SP-stacked, no early RPs |

**Championship formula:**
1. **Round 1 is almost always a hitter** (4 of 5 champions)
2. **Zero RPs in the top 3 rounds** (every champion except you in 2024, and you compensated with keeper value)
3. **At least 1 SP in the top 5 picks** (every champion)
4. **The SP-heavy approach wins** — 3 of 5 champions had 2+ SPs in their top 5 picks

## Actionable Takeaways for 2026

### 1. Draft a Hitter in Round 1
Four of five champions took a hitter first. In a 12-team league with deeper talent, an elite hitter in Round 1 provides the most stable foundation. Your championship year started with Corey Seager.

### 2. Take Your Ace SP by Round 3
Every champion had at least one ace SP in their top 5 picks. Don't wait until Round 4+ for your first starter. The sweet spot is Round 2–3 for an SP1.

### 3. Delay RPs Until Round 4+
Your tendency to take RPs in Rounds 1–2 (Romano, Clase) is the most aggressive in the league and it hasn't consistently translated to championships. The 2024 championship had RPs in Rounds 4–5, not 1–2. In a 7x7 with HLD, setup men are available later.

### 4. Leverage Your Keeper Pipeline
Your keeper stash strategy (Witt Jr., J-Rod, Elly, Soto, Tatis) is your biggest competitive advantage. Whoever you can keep at late-round value gives you a massive edge. Build around those keepers.

### 5. Focus Rounds 5–12 on Hitter Quality
Your 2022 draft (11th place) failed because mid-round hitters busted. Your 2024 draft (champion) had solid hitters filling those slots. In a 7x7 with negative Ks, target high-contact hitters with multi-category upside over boom-or-bust sluggers.

### 6. Exploit Opponent Tendencies
- **The Phavorites** will take a catcher early and an RP in Round 2 — don't compete
- **WaRshington Natinals, D.C. Funbaggers, LowBallers** will take SPs early — if you want one, pick before them
- **Curtis Granderslams** and **Late Round Fliers** go hitter-heavy — SPs will be available after their picks
- **Machine Needs Sugar** and **Ya Gotta Believe** take a pitcher in Round 1 — expect 2 fewer top SPs

### 7. The 12-Team Advantage
With 4 fewer teams than last year, there are ~92 fewer picks (4 teams × 23 rounds). Players who went in Rounds 8–10 in a 14-team league may slide to Rounds 6–8. Adjust your ADP expectations and be willing to wait on positions with depth.

### 8. Suggested Round-by-Round Framework
| Round | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | Elite hitter (SS, 3B, OF with 5-category upside) |
| 2–3 | Ace SP + strong hitter OR two strong hitters if SP falls |
| 4–5 | SP2 + first RP (elite closer or high-HLD setup man) |
| 6–8 | Fill remaining position needs + SP3 |
| 9–12 | Value hitters + RP2, C if elite option available |
| 13–16 | Bench depth + RP3–4 |
| 17–23 | Keeper stashes + roster filler |
