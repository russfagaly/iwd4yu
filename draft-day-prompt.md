## Draft Strategy Notes

### Offensive Priorities
- _What hitting categories am I targeting early?_
- _Which positions have the steepest drop-off (positional scarcity)?_
- _Negative K category: favor contact hitters over high-K sluggers?_

### Pitching Priorities
- _With 5 SP and 4 RP slots, what's my SP/RP draft balance?_
- _Holds (HLD) and Blown Saves (BSV) make reliever selection critical_
- _Target high-K, low-BB pitchers (both are categories)_
- _20 IP minimum: need reliable starters who stay healthy_

### Category Punting Considerations
- _Are there categories worth punting in a 7x7 H2H format?_
- _Which categories pair well together for a punt strategy?_

### Positional Scarcity Watch
- **C:**
- **SS:**
- **2B:**
- **OF:**
- **SP:**
- **RP (saves + holds):**
